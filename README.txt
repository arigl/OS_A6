Worked with:

- Filip Augustkowski

Project Description:

The objective of this assignment consists of writing a C/C++ program that translates logical to physical addresses for 

a virtual address space of size 216 = 65,536 bytes.Your program will read from a file containing logical addresses and, 

using a TLB as well as a page table, will translate each logical address to it's corresponding

physical address and output the value of the byte stored at the translated physical address. The goal behind 

this project is to simulate the steps involved in translating logical to physical addresses.

Run with:
./vmmgr addresses.txt
